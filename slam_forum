=================================================================

MAY NEED to create these new tables, not too difficult to implement:

Articles
  Generated with API calls to NewsApi.org.
      "See recent articles" button, to controller for articles, creates new
      api request with "candidates_name" in the url search. That basic
      information then added to articles table, and presented in the candidate
      show page.

Tags
  self explanatory.

Stretch:::
  Deployment
  Connect a user to their local representative, voting location, etc.
      (Voting Info Project)... Civic API.
      User provides location, we provide all relevant voting information they need.
      Question:
  Self-join posts to respond to other posts...
  GeoLocation of posts...

Questions:::
    API that lists all candidate policies?
    APIs in general, what can we easily gather?
