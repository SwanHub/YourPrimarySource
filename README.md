Primary Source is a website concept developed by Jackson Prince and Luke Menard in preparation for the 2020 Presidential election. It was developed in Ruby on Rails. Currently, there is no centralized source of information detailing media activity, polling percentages, financial data, policy information and biographical information for the Democratic candidates in the upcoming election.

We drew data from candidate websites, Rolling Stones articles, Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight, fec.gov and NewsApi.org.
