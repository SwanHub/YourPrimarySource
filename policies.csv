Michael Bennet,"Bennet does not support Medicare-for-All, instead favoring an expansion of the Affordable Care Act called “Medicare X.” Like other candidates who do not support a single-payer health care system, Bennet has warned that the the plan favored by progressives is not what it seems. In July, Bennet unveiled a plan to expand access to health care services in rural areas of America though Medicare X. The plan would invest in telemedicine (allowing doctors to see patients over video conference), expanding rural broadband, a measures aimed at combating the opioid epidemic, and more. ",,,"Bennet has bashed Trump’s approach to immigration, and in March reiterated his belief that a pathway to citizenship should be provided for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States when they were children.","Bennet has released a climate change plan he has dubbed “America’s Climate Change Plan.” It calls for net-zero emissions by 2050 at the latest and would use, as Bennet puts it “every diplomatic and economic tool available to assert America’s leadership in this critical fight.” The plan would also seek to “conserve 30 percent of America’s lands and oceans by 2030,” incentivize power providers to offer zero-emission energy, create a “Climate Bank” that lead to $10 trillion in private sector investment in innovation and infrastructure and more.",,"Bennet has not released a higher education plan, but his campaign told the New York Times that he wants to make sure “college students can pursue their studies without incurring the crushing burden of debt; more people seeking an alternative to college can pursue high-quality apprenticeships and job training; and Americans throughout their lives can advance their careers by improving their existing job skills or learning new ones.”",,,,,Bennet has promised to “do everything [he] possibly can” to protect Roe v. Wade.,"Bennet has released a multi-faceted plan to “fix our broken politics.” It involves overturning Citizens United, heightening transparency of Super PACs and other fundraising mechanisms (including social media ads), cracking down on campaign finance violations, banning members of Congress from ever becoming lobbyists, requiring all presidential candidates to release their tax returns, and more. “So much of what we got to get done — from climate to health care to changing the tax code — is going to require us to change the way our politics works,” Bennet said on a conference call in June. “Our plan responds to that by taking on the corruption in Washington and at the same time strengthening our democracy. It attempts to take the money out of politics and put the American people back in.”","Bennet has not proposed raising taxes on the wealthy, but his American Family Act would greatly expand the child tax credit, which currently provides up to $2,000 per child up to the age of 17. This plan would benefit lower-class and middle-class families with children, and, according to Vox, could cut poverty in the United States by over a third.",,"Included in Bennet’s plan to “fix our broken democracy” are several measures aimed at protecting the integrity of elections. He has called for automatic voter registration, making Election Day a national holiday, restoring voting rights to the formerly incarcerated, requiring states to allow students to vote where they attend school, and more.",
Joe Biden,"Biden does not support Medicare-for-All, instead favoring an expansion of the Affordable Care Act.","Since launching his campaign, Biden’s had to answer for his criminal justice stance in the ’80s and ’90s, including support for the 1994 Crime Bill and co-sponsoring the 1988 Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which created mandatory minimum sentences that treated crack cocaine more harshly than cocaine and contributed to the disproportionate incarceration of people of color.",Biden has pledged to close $1.6 trillion in “tax loopholes.”,"Biden’s website says, he would “pursue a humane immigration policy that upholds our values, strengthens our economy, and secures our border.” He recently pledged not to deport veterans who aren’t U.S. citizens. As a senator, he voted in favor of the Secure Fence Act to pay for 700 miles of wall construction on the U.S.-Mexico border.","Biden, who introduced one of the Senate’s first climate bills in 1986, has endorsed the framework of a Green New Deal and unveiled a $1.7 trillion plan to get to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.",,Biden’s first major policy rollout focused on K-12 education. The centerpiece of that plan is tripling Title I federal spending on schools that serve low-income students from $16 billion to $48 billion. Biden called for four years of free public college.,,,"Biden's foreign policy views are decidedly mainstream and centrist. He has slammed Trump’s “need to coddle autocrats and dictators” and called for more support of NATO and a strong response to Russia’s sustained assault on Western democracy, including in the U.S. Yet he also voted for the Iraq war, and supported President Obama’s escalation of the war in Afghanistan.","A longtime gun control advocate. In the past, he pushed for a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines as well as implementing universal background checks.","iden, a Roman Catholic, has said that he personally opposes abortion but because this conviction is based on his faith, he has no right to impose those views on other people.",Biden has disavowed Super PACs and fossil fuel money but not corporate PAC money or dark money nonprofit groups. His campaign has reportedly begun recruiting big-money fundraisers.,"Biden unveiled a plan aimed at revitalizing rural America. The plan features a bevy of economic initiatives, investment in clean energy solutions, tripling funding to expand rural broadband access, measure to improve access to health care in rural areas, and more.",,Biden website includes a call to protect “every American’s vote” — to make it easier for people of all races and classes to vote and protect our elections from foreign interference.,Biden has yet to take a position. He dismissed the idea of reparations in a 1975 interview that resurfaced in news reports before he entered the presidential race.
Cory Booker,"Booker supports Medicare for all. “Our broken health care system costs too much, is unsustainable, inefficient, unequal and unjust,” he tweeted in March. “No one living in the richest country in the world should die or go bankrupt because they can’t afford quality care. We need Medicare for all.”","Booker has led within the Democratic Party on criminal justice reform. He helped pass the First Step Act, which freed thousands of inmates sentenced to prison for drug-related offenses. He then introduced the Next Step Act to scale back mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent drug offenses, ban employers from asking prospective hires about their criminal history until late in the interview process, and improve training for law enforcement officers on racial bias issues.",,"In July, Booker unveiled a plan aimed at fixing America’s immigration system that includes a promise to “shut down inhumane facilities and require all facilities to meet the highest standards” on his first day in office. The plan also calls for expanding protections for DACA, expanding the availability of legal counseling for migrants seeking asylum, reforming Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection, appointing a special envoy to the North Triangle countries (Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador) producing many of the migrants traveling to the southern border, reversing immigration policies put in place by the Trump administration, and more. ",Booker says he backs the Green New Deal and recommitting the U.S. to the Paris climate accord.,,Booker has introduced legislation to make college debt-free. The bill would match state-level investments in higher ed with federal dollars so that students don’t have to take on debt to get a degree.,,,"Foreign policy has not been a centerpiece of Booker’s campaign so far, but as a member of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee he has spoken out against the Trump administration’s shadow war in Syria and against arm deals with Saudi Arabia. He backed the Iran nuclear deal and condemned Trump’s decision to pull out of it as “an abdication of American leadership.”","Booker’s plan is one of the more ambitious in the field. It calls for universal background checks and mandatory gun licenses to purchase a firearm, ratcheting up federal regulations of gun manufacturers (including giving the Consumer Product Safety Commission the power to oversee the industry), closing the “gun-show loophole,” and more.","In May, Booker slammed Georgia’s draconian “fetal heartbeat” bill as an “all-out attack on women.” Later that month, he released a plan that includes several measures to bolster reproductive rights, including the creation of a White House Office of Reproductive Freedom that would be “charged with coordinating and affirmatively advancing abortion rights and access to reproductive health care across my Administration .”",,"Booker’s signature economic policy is “baby bonds,” which are aimed at closing America’s glaring racial wealth gap by seeding “American Opportunity Accounts” for children. Every newborn baby in America would get $1,000 in a low-risk savings account managed by the Treasury Department. Children in low-income families would get an additional $2,000 per year until they’re 18. ","In June, Booker released an affordable housing plan, the centerpiece of which is a “Renters Credit” that would cap rental costs at 30 percent of the income of lower- and middle-class Americans. The plan would also reform zoning laws so more affordable housing could be constructed (and penalize cities that try to restrict land use), institute several anti-homelessness measures, beef up protections for tenants, and more.","Booker has pledged to put in place a new Voting Rights Act, a package of reforms that would combat voter suppression efforts (like those seen in Georgia’s 2018 gubernatorial election), end partisan gerrymandering, enact universal voter registration, and give former felons the ability to regain their right to vote.","One of the most vocal candidates on the issue, Booker introduced legislation in April to launch a federal commission to study federal reparations for African Americans."
Steve Bullock,"When he was asked last year in New Hampshire whether he supported Medicare-for-All, Bullock said that “health care ought to be affordable, accessibly and of quality. How we get there, there’s any number of different paths.”",,,"In 2017, Bullock was one of 11 governors to sign a letter urging Congress to take steps to protect the status of undocumented immigrants brought to America as children. He’s continued to advocate for Dreamers since announcing his campaign.","Bullock does not support the Green New Deal, telling the Washington Post that “we can do better with a more focused plan,” and that “we should significantly increase renewable energy, reverse the Trump Administration’s cuts to fuel efficiency standards and expand them to address the 37% of emissions that come from transportation, improve energy efficiency which could account for 30% of our overall goal, and follow the IPCC’s recommendation to invest in carbon capture.”",,"As governor of Montana, Bullock froze the cost of public college tuition. He has continued to advocate for affordable education while on the campaign trail. “Student debt has doubled in the last decade,” he said while in Iowa in May. “It’s $1.4 trillion — the average 2017 graduate has $28,000 of student loans, we’ve got to turn around and make college more affordable and accessible.”",,,,"Bullock was hesitant to adopt many of the gun safety measures popular among Democrats, but has recently been more open to reform. He said in 2018 that he supports universal background checks and magazine size restrictions.","“I begin from the premise that a woman should be able to make her own health decisions, in consultation with her doctor, if she chooses her family and faith,” Bullock told the Washington Post in May, adding that the restrictive bills passed in Alabama and Missouri “not only an attack on Alabama but an attack on women having domain in over their body.”","Bullock has based his campaign largely on tackling dark money in politics. Bullock has said that on his first day in office he will sign an executive order “requiring every company to disclose every dollar they spend or contribute to influence our elections if they want to do business with the largest contractor in the nation — the federal government.” He has also pledged to empower watchdog agencies go after groups that seek to “corrupt our elections,” ban Super PACs, pass the Disclose Act and work to overturn Citizens United.","“400 of the richest Americans own more wealth than the bottom 60% of people,” Bullock tweeted in June. “At the same time, the average worker hasn’t had a real wage increase in 40 years. Every American deserves a fair shot at success, not just the wealthy.”",,,
Pete Buttigieg,"Buttigieg has said a single-payer health care system is the “right place for us to head as a country,” but doesn’t think a Medicare-for-All model necessitates the elimination of the private insurance industry.","At the National Action Network convention in April, Buttigieg said he opposed solitary confinement. At the same conference, he argued the death penalty should be abolished. Buttigieg has also called for the elimination of the private prison industry, reforming pre-trial detention and cash bail, and incentivizing the reduction of mass incarceration.",,Buttigieg supports the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. He has also called for comprehensive immigration reform that would “end the backlogs in our lawful immigration and asylum processes.”,"Buttigieg supported the Paris climate accord, and in February told CNN that he believes the Green New Deal is “the right beginning” to tackling what he has described as a national emergency. He supports “a carbon tax-and-dividend for Americans, and major direct investment to build a 100% clean energy society.”","Struggling to garner support among African-American voters, Buttigieg in July unveiled “The Douglass Plan,” which his website describes as “a comprehensive investment in the empowerment of black America.” The sweeping set of proposals calls for reducing mass incarceration by 50 percent; reducing the racial wealth gap; ending racial health care bias; combating voter suppression; investing $25 billion in Historically Black Colleges and Universities; and other measures. ","Buttigieg bucked with some progressives in April when he seemed to oppose tuition-free college while speaking to students at Northeastern University. His plan calls for debt-free public college, as well as an increase in Pell Grants and more support for Historically Black Colleges and Universitiesand Minority-Serving Institutions.",,,"In June, Buttigieg delivered a foreign policy-focused speech at the Indiana University at Bloomington in which he laid out several proposals, including repealing and replacing the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF), which essentially gives the president unilateral authority to wage war, and withholding taxpayer money from Israel if it annexes the West Bank.","Buttigieg supports universal background checks, and is a member of the bipartisan group Mayors Against Illegal Guns. After the New Zealand mosque shooting in March, he called for military-style assault weapons to be banned, along with the establishment of a national gun licensing system, and the closure of the “boyfriend loophole,” which allows some domestic abusers to purchase guns so long as they were not married to the victim.","“The government’s role should be to make sure all women have access to comprehensive affordable care, and that includes preventive care, contraceptive services, prenatal and postpartum care, and safe and legal abortion,” Buttigieg’s website reads. He also supports the repeal of the Hyde Amendment, which restricts federal funding for abortion except in extreme cases such as rape and incest.",,"Buttigieg has also proposed raising the national minimum wage to $15 per hour, as well as exploring ways to deal with the effects of automation. He has also expressed openness to more radical solutions, telling Pod Save America that “it’s the right moment to have the conversation” about universal basic income.",,"Buttigieg supports automatic voter registration, expanding early voting, making Election Day a national holiday, and restoring voting rights for the formerly incarcerated — but at a CNN town hall in April he said that he didn’t support people being allowed to vote while incarcerated.","Buttigieg said in April that he is open to considering reparations. “The country as a whole is effectively segregated by race and the resources are different,” he said at the National Action Network convention. “There is a direct connection between exclusion in the past and exclusion in the present.”"
Julian Castro,"Castro supports Midecare-for-All in theory, although he has yet to lay out the specifics of what his plan would look like.","In June, Castro released his “People First Policing Plan,” which aims to “end over-aggressive policing and combat racially discriminatory policing,” “hold police accountable,” and “start the healing process between communities and law enforcement.” The plan would involve limiting the use of deadly force, demilitarizing the police, de-prioritizing minor offenses, mandating several new training programs, and more.",,"Immigration is one of the signature issues of Castro’s campaign. His “People First” immigration policy would break up ICE and shift its enforcement and removal powers to the Justice Department. It would create a pathway to citizenship for DREAMers, as well as for people with Temporary Protected Status and undocumented residents. It would also rescind Trump’s Muslim ban and “effectively end” the practice of detaining refugees who present themselves at the border. And it would establish a “21st-century Marshall Plan” for Central America to re-establish stability in the region.",Castro has promised to sign an executive order on his first day as president to recommit the U.S. to the Paris climate accord. He also supports the concept of a Green New Deal.,,"In May, Castro unveiled his “People First Education” plan, which includes tuition-free public college, community college, and vocational school, as well as government-funded universal pre-K. Castro also wants to help relieve student debt. His plan holds that if an American with outstanding student loans is earning less than 250 percent of the federal poverty line, they do not have to make loan payments.",,,"Castro said little about foreign policy in his 2020 announcement speech. He has criticized Trump’s America First agenda and defended the post-World War II Western alliance. “The first thing that I would do if I were president with regard to our relationships around the world is to strengthen them, because those alliances have helped keep us safe,” he said in January.","Following the August shootings in El Paso and Dayton that left 31 dead, Castro unveiled a plan to combat white nationalism and gun violence. The plan calls for domestic terrorism investigations to be rebalanced so appropriate attention is given to white nationalist terror; the creation of a White House Initiative on Disarming Hate, as well as other programs to combat hate; and several gun control measures, including ending the gun show loophole, enacting universal background checks, requiring a license to purchase any firearms, renewing a ban on assault weapons, and more.",Castro supports a woman’s right to choose and Roe v. Wade.,"Castro has refused to accept “a dime” of PAC money of any kind, corporate or not.","Castro hasn’t released a specific tax plan yet. But he has voiced support for plans to tax the wealthiest Americans, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s proposals for a 60 or 70 percent marginal tax rate for people who make more than $10 million.","In June, Castro, who was the secretary of Housing and Urban Development for three years under President Obama, unveiled his “People First Housing” plan, a three-part initiative that aims to solve housing affordability and homelessness, strengthen anti-discrimination measures, crack down on Wall Street’s mortgage-lending practices, and support homeownership. Measures include creating a tax credit for low- and middle-income renters, expanding HUD’s ability to enforce the Fair Housing Act, working to stem displacement caused by gentrification, establishing a National Housing Stabilization Fund, and more.","Castro has spoken out about the need to protect voting rights and voiced support for giving some, but not all, felons the right to vote.","He supports some form of reparations but he has yet to lay out a specific plan. He reiterated his support for reparations — not just considering them, but making them — on Juneteenth."
Bill de Blasio,"In January, de Blasio guaranteed that everyone in New York City, including undocumented immigrants, would be able to receive affordable health care. De Blasio has not offered specifics on how he would translate the plan nationally, although during the opening night of the first Democratic debates in June, he was one of only two of the 10 candidates onstage (the other being Elizabeth Warren) to raise their hand when the moderator asked who supports ending the private health insurance industry.","Stop-and-frisk has declined since de Blasio took over as mayor, and in 2016 he signed the Criminal Justice Reform Act, which focused on reforming the handling of low-level offenses.",,"De Blasio has pushed to make New York a “sanctuary city,” and promised that police in New York will not target undocumented immigrants. In March, he urged Congress to pass the Dream and Promise Act, which would provide a pathway to citizenship for immigrants brought to the United States while children.","De Blasio has taken measures to combat climate change as mayor of New York. He recently proposed an ambitious plan to mitigate the effects of sea level rise. In April, he announced the introduction of legislation to require builders to use more environmentally friendly materials, part of a $14 billion “NYC Green New Deal” that would help New York become carbon neutral by 2050.",,De Blasio has called for student loan debt forgiveness for veterans with disabilities.,,"De Blasio’s primary achievement as the mayor of New York is probably his institution of universal pre-K. The program has been praised since it was implemented, and, as the New York Times points out, pre-K enrollment has nearly quadrupled since de Blasio took office in 2013.",,"De Blasio has on several occasions called for Congress to pass common sense gun safety legislation. “A clear majority of Americans would like common sense gun safety legislation,” he tweeted in response to the 2017 church shooting that left 26 dead in Sutherland Springs, Texas. “Every single tragedy is a chance for Congress to act.”","De Blasio does not support the Hyde Amendment, which bars federal funding for abortion except in extreme cases.",,"As the mayor of New York, de Blasio has pushed for a “millionaires’ tax,” which he has said will be used to fix the city’s decrepit subway system. De Blasio has also pushed for the minimum wage to be raised to $15.",,"De Blasio has advocated for voting rights as mayor, and expressed a desire to make New York the “fairest big city in America.” In 2018, he pledged to devote more city money to elections and registering more voters, including the incarcerated. In May 2019, he offered $75 million to help open up to 100 new early voting sites in the city.",De Blasio has said he would create a commission to study reparations if he were elected president.
John Delaney,"Though Delaney writes on his website that he believes healthcare is a “fundamental right” and that he is “proposing a universal health care plan,” he is not in favor of some of the more progressive Medicare-for-All options backed by candidates like Bernie Sanders. Delaney’s plan involves providing every American under 65 with basic public health insurance. Americans would be able to opt out of public healthcare and receive a tax credit if they want to buy insurance from a private provider, or buy additional insurance from a private provider to supplement their government-provided insurance.  Medicare would remain in place for Americans over 65.","In April, Delaney introduced a 13-point plan to address criminal justice disparity. “Our criminal justice system has a demonstrated clear bias against people of color,” he wrote. “Black people, who are approximately 13% of the US population, make up 40% of the incarcerated population.” The plan includes ending for-profit prisons, ending mandatory minimum sentences, removing marijuana from Schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act, heightening transparency within police departments, and funding for programs to reduce recidivism.",,"Delaney believes in a path for citizenship for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children. However, he doesn’t believe that border crossings should be decriminalized. ","In May, Delaney unveiled a $4 trillion climate change plan that would bring the United States to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The plan involves charging a $15 fee for each metric ton of carbon dioxide emitted, which would then raise by $10 year after year. Fossil fuel subsidies would end, and states would receive grants for preventing forest fires, using electric transportation and reducing emissions. Delaney also wants to create a “Climate Corps” that would tie into his plan to introduce a new national service program.",,"Delaney has proposed a national service program for young people graduating from high school. The plan would aim to enroll 200,000 high school graduates in the first year of the program, which would provide incentives to work on various building and infrastructure projects managed by both nonprofit and for-profit companies.",,,"Delaney has criticized President Trump for pulling the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal. He has also supported the president’s willingness to sit down with Kim Jong-un, and has praised the “progress” made regarding North Korea. When the New York Times asked Delaney in June whether there would be troops in Afghanistan at the end of his first term in office, he said it is “in our self-interest as a country to keep a small presence there.”","Delaney has said he wants to take a three-pointed approach to gun control that involves universal background checks, limiting the availability of military-style assault rifles, and passing a national red flag law, which would allow Americans to argue to a court that someone who poses a danger to them should not be permitted to carry a firearm.",Delaney supports abortion rights and has defended government funding of Planned Parenthood.,,"Delaney does not support the idea of a wealth tax, a la that of Elizabeth Warren, and has even argued that it might not be constitutional. Instead, he has proposed raising the tax rate on capital gains and matching it with the normal income tax rate.",,"While in Congress, Delaney introduced the Open Our Democracy Act, which would prohibit gerrymandering and require an independent commission to draw congressional boundaries. Delaney also supports automatic voter registration, making Election Day a national holiday and restoring the Voting Rights Act.","Delaney has said he would support H.R. 40, a bill that would create a commission to study and develop reparation proposals for African Americans."
Tulsi Gabbard,"Gabbard supports universal health care, and co-sponsored the Medicare-for-All Act, which was introduced to the House of Representatives in 2017. She does, however, believe that Americans should have the option to remain their private insurance providers.",,,,"In 2017, Gabbard introduced the Off Fossil Fuels for a Better Future Act, which aims to bring the United States to 100 percent reusable energy by 2035. “For too long, our nation has failed to take action on climate change, putting the future of our people and our planet in danger,” she said of the bill the following February. That November, Gabbard spoke alongside Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in support of the Green New Deal. She ultimately did not co-sponsor the legislation, however, explaining in February that she has “some concerns with the Green New Deal, and about some of the vagueness of the language in there.”","As soon as she declared her candidacy, she was met with a flood of criticism for her past views regarding the LGBTQ community, particularly relating to her work for the Alliance for Traditional Marriage, which fought against gay rights in Hawaii. Gabbard initially ran for office on her drive “to pass a constitutional amendment to protect traditional marriage” in the state while working with the group. She also ran a group called Stop Promoting Homosexual America, and has objected to children being taught that homosexuality is normal. She soon apologized later in January.","Gabbard supports Bernie Sanders’ College for All Act, which would eliminate undergraduate tuition at four-year public universities for families making up to $125,000, make all community college tuition-free and reform the student loan system.",,,"Gabbard has been stridently anti-interventionist, and believes the United States should withdraw troops from Afghanistan and Syria. But her approach to foreign policy has gone beyond taking a strong anti-war position. She has been widely criticized for visiting murderous Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in 2017 on a secret “fact-finding” mission while dismissing his opposition — across the board — as “terrorists.”",Gabbard has advocated for a federal ban on military-style assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.,"Though Gabbard was anti-abortion early in her career, she has voted in favor of abortion rights on several occasions, and currently has a 100 rating from Planned Parenthood.",,"Though she has not offered specifics, Gabbard wrote in 2017 that “there is no question our tax code needs serious reform” before explaining why she voted against Trump’s tax cut for the wealthy. “This bill isn’t about real tax reform—it’s a giveaway to corporations and special interests on the backs of people who are already struggling just to make ends meet,” she wrote.",,"Gabbard doesn’t believe people on parole should be allowed to vote, despite their ability to in Hawaii.","Gabbard is open to the idea of reparations, and co-sponsored H.R. 40, a House bill that would create “a commission to study and develop reparations proposals for African Americans.”"
Kirsten Gillibrand,"Gillibrand is a co-sponsor of the Medicare-for-All legislation introduced to the Senate by Bernie Sanders, but her support for the concept pre-dates Sanders’ 2016 run, which helped spark a national debate on MFA.","The United States, Gillibrand has said, is in the midst of a “mass incarceration crisis.” Her prescription for fixing the problem involves legalizing marijuana at the federal level, expunging old records, reforming sentencing laws, changing federal rules for prisons, ending cash bail, and investing in communities disproportionately impacted by “the racist war on drugs.”",,"“We need to secure our borders effectively, but also make loud and clear that racism and fear of our neighbor are not a national security strategy,” Gillibrand’s website reads. “Building a taxpayer funded wall, ripping families apart, banning Muslims and turning our backs on refugees and asylum seekers are cruel and ineffective policies.”","Gillibrand co-sponsored a resolution supporting the Green New Deal introduced in February. She’s said that when it comes to confronting climate change, “I think we need a moonshot. We need to tell the American people: we are going to have a green economy in the next 10 years, not because it’s easy, but because it’s hard, because it’s a measure of our innovation and effectiveness.”",,"Gillibrand has proposed rewarding a year of public service with student loan debt forgiveness. “If you do public service for a year, you get two years free of community college or state school,” she said during a recent MSNBC town hall. “Do two years of public service, you get four years free. That would create a pipeline of kids doing service for someone else.”",,"Gillibrand in May unveiled her plan to create a Family Bill of Rights, a new economic policy platform she says she will “get done” within her first 100 days in office. The plan includes universal pre-K, national paid family leave, measures to ensure child care is accessible and affordable, and more.","Gillibrand has called for a “strong, strategic foreign policy.” A member of the Senate Armed Services committee, she has also declared that “military engagements should not continue without a clear strategy, defined and achievable goals and the consent of Congress through new Authorizations for the Use of Military Force. America’s commander in chief is not a dictator, and the decision to deploy our troops can never be made lightly or unilaterally.”","Back in 2008, when she was still a representative for an upstate New York congressional district, Gillibrand was a stalwart defender of gun rights, going so far as to file an amicus brief in support of overturning a handgun ban in Washington, D.C., which enshrined the individual right to possess a firearm under the Constitution.  Gillibrand, who now proudly boasts of her F rating from the NRA, supports universal background checks and the banning of assault rifles. She’s also spoken of the need to stop gun trafficking and close gun sale loopholes.","Gillibrand has declared she will exclusively nominate judges and justices who will uphold Roe v. Wade. She’s also committed to working to end the Hyde Amendment — which bans federal funds from being used for abortions except in cases of rape, incest, and if the life of the mother is at risk — and repealing the Trump administration’s “gag rule” prohibiting abortion providers who accept federal funding or insurance from talking about abortion with their patients. She wants to expand access to birth control, guarantee sex education, and invest in  Title X family planning funding. And she has expressed a desire to create protections for doctors, nurses, and clinic workers, although she hasn’t specified what kind of protections that would include. ","Gillibrand has released a “clean elections” plan that amounts to a call for public financing of elections. Under the plan, every voter would be eligible for $200 “Democracy Dollars” they could donate to the federal candidate of their choice — as long as that candidate swore off donations of more than $200. Gillibrand’s team says the proposal could be paid for “by eliminating a taxpayer subsidy that is currently enjoyed by CEOs who make excessive salaries.”","Gillibrand — who represents the country’s financial nerve-center, Wall Street — supports a tax on financial transactions: 0.5 percent on stock trades and 0.1 percent on bond trades. She also supports raising the national minimum wage to $15 per hour, and wants to reverse Trump’s 2017 tax cut for the wealthy.",,"Gillibrand has expressed a desire to restore the Voting Rights Act that was gutted by the Supreme Court in 2013, and has said the U.S. should go further by enacting automatic voter registration for every 18-year-old, expanding online registration and early voting, making Election Day a national holiday, and end gerrymandering and voter roll purges.",Gillibrand has said she would like to “study the problem.”
Kamala Harris,"In July, Harris unveiled her 2020 health care proposal in a Medium post titled, “My Plan for Medicare for All.” The plan calls for the expansion of the current Medicare system while allowing “private insurers to offer Medicare plans as a part of this system that adhere to strict Medicare requirements on costs and benefits.” Harris’ plan sets the U.S. on track to adopt a Medicare-for-All-style system in 10 years.","Harris’ record as prosecutor, district attorney, and the attorney general of California, a position she held from 2011-2017, has come under intense scrutiny as she has rolled out her presidential campaign. Though she did embrace many progressive measures as San Francisco’s DA and then as the state’s AG, she also started an anti-truancy program aimed at punishing parents whose children missed school, tried to prevent the release of prisoners despite an overcrowding problem, and supported the death penalty.",,"Harris has said we should “re-examine” the role of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), suggesting that it could be time to scrap the agency. Harris has been criticized, however, for supporting a policy that turned over arrested undocumented youth to ICE when she was the San Francisco district attorney.","Harris has a strong record on climate action — including sponsoring a bill that would give grants to coastal communities to prepare for sea-level rise and, when she was California’s attorney general, investigating ExxonMobil for its reported lies about the risks of climate change.","Harris has released what her website describes as the “most aggressive equal pay proposal in history.” The plan calls for companies to obtain “Equal Pay Certification,” which involves proving through various means that they are not giving preferential treatment to men over women in regard to pay, promotions, and more.","In April, Harris wrote on Medium that she was co-sponsoring the College For All Act, which eliminates tuition and fees for public colleges and universities for 80 percent of Americans (those earning less than $125,000 per year).",,Harris said during a CNN town hall event in January that she “absolutely” supports a nationwide paid parental-leave policy.,"The senator has come under scrutiny from the more progressive wing of the party for her cozy relationship with Israel, and her failure to publicly condemn the nation’s human rights abuses against Palestinians.","In April, Harris said that if Congress does not enact meaningful gun legislation within her first 100 days in office, she would take executive action to bring about several gun control measures.","In May, Harris unveiled a plan to institute what she calls the Reproductive Rights Act, which would prevent states “with a history of violating Roe v. Wade” from enacting abortion-restricting laws without first clearing the legislation with the Justice Department.",,"Harris wants to focus on offering relief for the lower and middle classes. She’s unveiled a nearly $3 trillion plan that would provide a tax credit of $3,000 for single Americans making up to $30,000 annually and $6,000 for married couples making up to $60,000.","In April, Harris reintroduced to the Senate her Rent Relief Act, a bill aimed at combating rising rent costs by offering a refundable tax credit to Americans making less than $100,000 a year who spending at least 30 percent of their income on rent and utilities.","Harris has called for the need to “update and reinvigorate” the Voting Rights Act, and tweeted the need for legislation to expand early voting, modernize voting systems and curb the effect of discriminatory voting laws.","Harris has said that the idea of reparations needs to be considered. In March, she spoke to NPR about the generational effects of slavery — including how African Americans have higher rates of heart disease and high blood pressure — suggesting reparations could come in the form of mental health treatment."
Jay Inslee,"Inslee has yet to take a firm position specifically on Medicare-for-All. He supports universal health care and, as governor of Washington state, signed a bill creating a public option and expanded Medicaid access, leading to nearly 630,000 adults and children getting covered.","As governor of Washington, Inslee launched a “Marijuana Justice Initiative” to offer pardons to people who’ve been convicted for a single marijuana possession misdemeanor between from 1998 to 2012. Inslee’s office said the policy could affect as many as 3,500 people. Inslee is also opposed to the death penalty.",,"Inslee was the first governor to announce that he’d welcome Syrian refugees, and Washington was the first state to sue Trump to stop the Muslim travel ban. In May, Inslee unveiled his “America’s Promise” plan to overhaul the immigration system. In it, Inslee promises to do away with Trump’s border wall, end the Muslim ban and protect Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) within the first 100 days of his presidency. The plan also calls for accepting more refugees; restoring aid to Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador; and revamping the immigration system “so it is humane, just, and efficient, centered on a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and expedited eligibility for DREAMers.”","Climate change is Inslee’s signature issue, and, more than that, the central organizing principle of his 2020 run for president. Inslee would recommit the U.S. to the Paris climate accord and praises the idea of a Green New Deal. But his policy ideas go further. Inslee released the first plank of his sprawling plan to tackle the global climate crisis in May, providing a detailed roadmap for quickly getting to 100 percent clean energy in America — in homes, cars and trucks, and electricity generation. He has also proposed establishing a 10-year, $9 trillion investment plan that includes the establishment of a “Climate Conservation Corps” to hire young Americans to build the clean energy economy by retrofitting buildings, installing rooftop solar, and more; being more proactive in collaborating with the international community to find solutions; and transitioning the economy off of its reliance on fossil fuels, an ambitious plan that involves ending all fossil fuel subsidies.",,"Inslee has yet to release a 2020 plan on higher education affordability, but he is poised to sign legislation in Washington state that would use a tax on tech companies to make two- and four-year public college nearly free for students coming from middle-class background.",,,"Inslee’s foreign policy views, to the extent he has them, tend to emphasize the need for international cooperation to combat the climate crisis. In 2017, he helped launch the U.S. Climate Alliance, a coalition of governors and mayors who came together to show the rest of the world that, despite Trump’s actions, many Americans are still committed to fighting climate change. As a congressman in the early 2000s, he voted against the Iraq war.","Inslee has yet to release a gun control plan as part of his campaign, but he recently signed several bills to ban 3D-printed “ghost guns,” close gun-sale loopholes, and strengthen Washington’s background-check process. He called out Trump to his face, at a televised White House meeting, for suggesting that teachers arm themselves to defend against active shooters, an idea opposed by many teachers: “We need a little less tweeting, a little more listening.”","As governor, Inslee signed into law the nation’s first reproductive parity law that requires nearly all insurance plans in Washington state to cover the cost of reproductive health care.",Inslee pledged not to accept any donations tied to the fossil fuel industry and has refused any corporate PAC money. He’s faced criticism from reform groups for not disavowing a single-candidate Super PAC devoted to helping his campaign.,"As governor of Washington, Inslee proposed a new state-level capital gains tax on the sale of stocks and bonds as well as business tax on companies that sell software as a service. Inslee’s administration estimated that the two proposals would generate $3.5 billion in revenue in the next few years, and that money would pay for revamping the state’s behavioral health system, protecting endangered orcas, environmental initiatives, and education investments. Inslee also supported legislation to raise Washington’s minimum wage to $12 per hour.",,"On the campaign trail, Inslee has called for an end to gerrymandering. In 2018, he signed bills to allow people to register to vote up to and on Election Day, to make voter registration automatic when you renew your driver’s license, and to allow 16- and 17-year-olds to pre-register to vote.","“I think that we have a history in this country that we need to remedy,” Inslee told PBS in March. He supports broader policies to end intergenerational poverty and mass incarceration but has yet to announce a specific plan on the topic of reparations."
Amy Klobuchar,"Klobuchar sees Medicare-for-All as a “possibility in the future,” but says she’s focused on more immediately achievable results. The Minnesota senator feels the path to universal health care begins by expanding the Affordable Care Act to include a public option — specifically allowing insurance customers on state exchanges to buy into Medicaid, the program that currently serves the disadvantaged.","A former prosecutor who declined to file charges against nearly two dozen officers who killed suspects, Klobuchar wrote in an op-ed for CNN that “we have finally started to acknowledge that there is racism in our criminal justice system and that we need to take action to fight it.” She has proposed creating a federal clemency advisory board, and appointing a White House post, outside of the Department of Justice, to shape policies on criminal justice reform.",,"Klobuchar supports a pathway to citizenship for most undocumented immigrants and an increase in legal immigration. She calls for reform, rather than abolition, of ICE.","Klobuchar co-sponsored the Green New Deal as an “aspiration,” calling it “a framework to jump-start a discussion.” She pledges a restoration of Obama-era climate policies, including rejoining the Paris climate accord on Day One and restoring the Clean Power Plan and Obama’s fuel-efficiency standards for vehicles. She’s also called for “sweeping legislation” for green buildings. She has said that within her first 100 days in office she will introduce climate legislation that will put the United States on a path to net zero carbon emissions by 2050.",,"Klobuchar does not support free public-college tuition, suggesting that it would take a “magic genie” to be able to afford such a policy. Klobuchar does support free community college, better refinancing options for student debt, and an expansion of Pell grants.",,"Klobuchar is a co-sponsor of the American Family Act, which would send parents as much as $300 per month, per child, to defray the costs of raising a family. Klobuchar has been a vocal proponent of family-leave policies, but her own office’s policy called for women to repay the leave benefits they used.",Klobuchar has decried Trump’s “foreign policy by tweet.” She voted with Republicans in a resolution of disapproval when Trump announced a precipitous withdrawal of American troops from Syria and Afghanistan.,"Klobuchar supports an assault weapons ban, universal background checks, and closing the “boyfriend loophole,” which allows some domestic abusers to purchase guns so long as they were not married to the victim. She has said she balances her support of gun control against the interests of her sportsmen relatives.","Klobuchar has said she’d seek to codify Roe v. Wade in law if it were overturned by the Supreme Court, and has called the slate of anti-abortion legislation in states like Alabama and Georgia “a violation of civil rights.” In the past, Klobuchar has spoken of seeking “common ground” on abortions, “making them safe and making them rare.”",,Klobuchar wants to raise the corporate income tax from its Trump-tax-cut low of 21 percent to 25 percent as part of a plan to pay for a $650 billion infrastructure package. Klobuchar has also said that she will increase the minimum wage for federal contractors to $15 per hour within her first 100 days in office.,,"Klobuchar supports federal, automatic voter registration at age 18, a reform she says could create 22 million new voters. She has also emphasized the role of state governments in expanding voting rights.","Klobuchar has called for investment in communities hurt by racism but insisted, “it doesn’t have to be a direct pay for each person.”"
Wayne Messam,"Messam has said he supports the idea of Medicare-for-All, and is open to a system that retains the private insurance industry. “As President, I will be open to ideas to fix a broken system that right now does more to protect the bottom line of insurance and pharmaceutical companies than protecting patients,” his website reads.",,,"Messam has said that America’s immigration system needs to be overhauled. “Washington had failed the American people when it comes to immigration,” he told CBS in April, adding that “when we have a process and a political will in place to ensure comprehensive immigration reform, we will be able to subside some of the issues that we are currently seeing right now.”","Messam told the Washington Post that he supports “the urgency and the end goal” of the Green New Deal, but has said that he will unveil his own climate policy. He was also one of 407 mayors to sign a pledge to uphold the principles of the Paris climate accord despite President Trump’s decision to remove the United States from the agreement.",,"The tentpole of Messam’s campaign is his proposal to cancel all $1.5 trillion of outstanding student loan debt. Messam’s plan calls for all 44 million Americans with outstanding student loan debt to be informed of its relief within 60 days. The United States Treasury would pay off the debt. Messam argues that lifting this economic burden off tens of millions of Americans would outweigh the financial cost to the nation, which he says would ultimately be paid for by canceling the Trump’s tax cut for the wealthy that was passed in 2017.",,,"Though he hasn’t offered many specifics, Messam has said that “we need to change course, rebuild our fractured alliances and lead by example” on the global stage. He has also advocated for a two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and Palestine.","Messam has been strong on gun safety, and has often cited the shooting at Parkland, which is less than 50 miles away from his home of Miramar, in calling for reform. His goals as president are pretty ambitious: “It will be my goal as your President to cut gun deaths in half by the end of my first term, with the goal to eliminate this threat entirely by the end of my presidency,” his website reads.","“As President, I will vigorously defend the a woman’s right to choose and nominate a @USSupremeCourt justice that recognizes his question became settled law in 1973,” Messam tweeted in May.",,Messam has proposed canceling the Trump administration’s 2017 tax cut for the wealthy. He tweeted in June that all Americans “should earn a wage that allows them to meet their basic needs.”,,"“Across this country, voting rights are under attack as politicians create barriers that make it harder for people to register to vote and cast their ballots, cut back early voting, and engage in unconstitutional acts of voter suppression,” Messam’s website reads, adding that “we must protect Americans’ right to vote regardless of economic and societal status — not limit participation in the democratic process and discriminate against our own people.”",
Seth Moulton,"Moulton does not support Medicare-for-All. Instead, he had advocated for strengthening the Affordable Care Act with a “modern public option” that will allow it to compete with the private insurance industry. Moulton has placed a premium on mental health care, especially for veterans. He has called for the funding of yearly mental health screenings for every high schooler in America, establishing a national mental health crisis hotline, and making mental health check-ups routine both for veterans and active-duty service members.",,,,"Moulton signed on as a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal in February. A month later, he wrote an op-ed for the Des Moines Register arguing that the legislation should be focused on creating jobs. Moulton has also indicated that he supports the idea of a climate change-focused primary debate.","In June, Moutlon unveiled a plan to review and upgrade service members who were less-than-honorably discharged because of sexual orientation or “homosexual activity.”","Moulton has unveiled a national service initiative that would give Americans aged 17 to 24 an education benefit based on how many years they dedicate to national service. A one-year commitment would provide a benefit equal to 60 percent of the cost of tuition to an in-state public university (or job benefit training of up to $14,000). A two-year commitment would provide a benefit of 80 percent (or $19,000). A three-year commitment would provide a benefit of 100 percent (or $24,000). The plan also calls for the creation of a Federal Green Corps to combat climate change, and would make the administrator of the National and Community Service Administration a Cabinet-level position.",,,"Moulton has made national security a focus of his campaign, calling for smarter investment in the military, including “dramatically increasing our investment in autonomous, hypersonic, and cyber weapons — and continuing to invest in basic scientific research, education, and immigration.” He has also called for the creation of a Pacific NATO to combat growing threats from China and Russia.","Moulton, an Iraq veteran, has long been a vocal proponent of stricter gun laws, and has introduced multiple gun control bills to the House. He has called for several measures, including universal background checks, as well as banning 3D-printed guns and military-style assault rifles.","“We are currently in the midst of the most aggressive attack on women’s rights in decades,” Moulton tweeted in May. “If elected, I’m committed to only nominating judges who would uphold Roe v. Wade. I’m calling on all Democratic candidates to do the same.”",,"Moulton derided Trump’s 2017 tax cut for the wealthy and has advocated for tax reform. “It’s not fair that people on Wall Street are paying lower tax rates than people who have hard-working jobs, working two or three jobs,” he said in May on MSNBC, going on to say that he wants to “equalize rates.” Moulton has also derided the wealth tax proposed by Elizabeth Warren.",,"Moulton has called for a New Voting Rights Act that would include automatic voter registration, abolishing the Electoral College, giving statehood to Washington D.C., and Puerto Rico, making Election Day a national holiday, restoring voting rights to felons who have served time and more.",
Beto O'Rourke,"O’Rourke says he is for universal health care but he’s equivocated about Medicare-for-All specifically — supporting the measure when he was running for Senate in Texas, but distancing himself since launching his bid for president.","While campaigning for Senate, O’Rourke called for ending mandatory minimums for minor drug offenses, ending cash bail, and stopping the use of private prisons",,"O’Rourke has made immigration on of his signature issues. The El Paso native has pledged to dismantle the Trump administration’s “cruel and cynical” policies through a series of executive actions: rescinding the travel ban, ending family separation, halting work on the border wall, requiring detention only for immigrants with criminal backgrounds, eliminating funding for for-profit detention centers, increasing refugee resettlement efforts, working toward a permanent legislative solution for individuals with DACA or Temporary Protected Status, and overhauling the asylum system. O’Rourke, who has also committed to cracking down on smugglers and traffickers, says he supports the Bush-era law that criminalizes border crossings on the grounds that there needs to be a “legal mechanism” to hold coyotes legally responsible for their actions.","O’Rourke was one of the first in the Democratic field to release a detailed plan to address the climate crisis. His proposal calls for net-zero emissions by 2050, a recommitment to the Paris Agreement, and an investment of $1.5 trillion (designed to stimulate additional spending of $5 trillion over 10 years) in clean-energy research and infrastructure improvements in the communities that will bear the brunt of climate change.",,"“I am not for free college for all,” O’Rourke has said. Instead, he’s proposed refinancing at lower rates the estimated $1.5 trillion in American student debt, and discussed the possibility of expanding the government’s troubled Public Service Loan Forgiveness program that is supposed to wipe out debt in exchange for public service.",,,"O’Rourke says Trump has “made a mess of our foreign policy,” but he hasn’t offered details on what his own foreign policy would look like.  ","O’Rourke — who has spoken of owning guns himself and teaching his children how to use them — supports universal background checks, magazine limits, and restrictions on some semiautomatic weapons, including America’s most popular rifle, the AR-15, which he’s called “a weapon of war designed for the sole purpose of taking lives.”","O’Rourke has said he would appoint an attorney general who would prioritize protecting reproductive rights, and he would reverse the Trump administration’s “gag rule” banning doctors who work in offices or clinics that accept federal funding from speaking about abortion. He supports ending the Hyde Amendment, which prevents federal funding from being used for abortions except in extreme cases like rape and incest, and increasing funding for Title X, the federal family planning program. He’s expressed a commitment to appointing judges who would uphold Roe v. Wade, and said he would encourage the passage of federal legislation codifying Roe’s protections, as well as legislation prohibiting abortion restrictions on private insurance.","As he did during his fundraising record-shattering bid for Senate, O’Rourke has sworn off donations from political action committees. He’s also officially laid out a detailed list of policy prescriptions intended to get money out of politics. Among the items on that laundry list: banning PAC contributions to all campaigns; limiting individual contributions to $2,000; making political contributions tax deductible; requiring public companies, large private companies, and all government contractors to disclose all political contributions and federal lobbying efforts; requiring disclosure within 48 hours for any donations of $1,000 or more; prohibiting U.S. companies with substantial foreign ownership from donating to campaigns; and imposing limits on how much can be contributed to a political party. O’Rourke has also sworn-off donations from the oil, gas, and coal industries and their executives after sustained pressure from environmental activists.","On the campaign trail, O’Rourke has voiced support for Elizabeth Warren’s wealth tax, giving a somewhat tortured explanation for why. “Both for reasons of generating the revenue that we need and reasons to achieve the political democracy by having an economic democracy, some part of that wealth that has been built up, and continues to be built up, and receives favorable preferential treatment in the tax code, must be taxed for our common benefit,” he said, adding that the revenue could be used to finance infrastructure projects and health care policies.",,"On his campaign website, O’Rourke describes a plan to register 50 million new voters, institute automatic registration, same day-registration, early voting, and vote-by-mail in all 50 states, and calls on Congress to make Election Day a national holiday. He also wants to amend Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act ”to make clear that even seemingly race-neutral election regulations are unlawful when they result in disproportionate impact on racial minorities,” and make the protection of voting rights a priority in his Justice Department.",O’Rourke reiterated his support for reparations in a July Medium essay in which he reckoned with the realization that he and his wife are descended from people who owned slaves.

As a candidate he’s called for rewriting the tax code to spur the growth of electric car and solar panel manufacturing. Ryan’s campaign has focused on dealing with the hollowing out of the manufacturing industry, which he has experienced firsthand in Congress — Lordstown, Ohio, where a major GM plant recently shut down, is in his district. He sees electric cars and renewable energy as the future where the traditional manufacturing industry is failing. Ryan has also called for a general raise in wages through a $15 national minimum wage.",,"As a congressman, Ryan has opposed efforts to restrict people’s right to vote. He calls voting rights “a cornerstone of our democracy.”","Ryan is a co-sponsor of H.R. 40, a bill that would create a commission to study and develop reparation proposals for African Americans.

Sanders also seeks to end cash bail, mandatory minimums, private prisons, and the death penalty.","Sanders is targeting the wealth of America’s oligarchs, and has proposed hiking the estate tax to 77 percent on the fortunes of the very wealthiest, aiming to raise “$2.2 trillion from the nation’s 588 billionaires,” including $74 billion from the Koch brothers alone.","Sanders speaks about immigration in more conservative terms than some 2020 competitors. “What we need is comprehensive immigration reform,” he said stumping in Iowa. “If you open the borders, my God, there’s a lot of poverty in this world, and you’re going to have people from all over the world. And I don’t think that’s something that we can do at this point. Can’t do it.

He has called for free public college tuition, with the federal government covering 67 percent of this cost and states the remaining 33 percent.",,"In addition to calling for universal pre-K, Sanders wants universal child care.","Sanders’ rhetoric on foreign policy has often mirrored his domestic priorities, condemning the power of corporate multinationals and oligarchic concentrations of wealth. His record leans toward an anti-interventionist stance — he voted against the Iraq war and more recently did not support ousting Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro.","Sanders has been slow to evolve on gun control. He voted for the NRA-backed 2005 bill that made most gun makers immune from accountability for misuse of their weapons, sparking the reckless marketing of military-style weapons.","In addition to calling for universal pre-K, Sanders wants universal child care.

Elizabeth Warren,Warren has voiced support for the idea of Medicare-for-All,"In June, Warren released a plan to ban private prisons, stop contractors from marking up prices on commissary goods, and install an independent Prison Conditions Monitor inside Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General.","Warren has the most aggressive tax-the-rich proposal in the field. Under her “Ultra-Millionaire” wealth tax, households with a net worth of more than $50 million would be taxed 2 percent on every dollar of net worth above $50 million, and a 3 percent on every dollar of net worth above $1 billion.","In July, she delivered by unveiling a sweeping plan that includes “remaking” ICE and Customs and Border Protection; allowing more refugees into the United States; ending the abuse of migrants and reducing detention; and decriminalizing border crossings.","Warren’s “Green Manufacturing Plan” takes inspiration from both the Apollo program and the Marshall Plan to “develop, manufacture, and export the technology the world needs to confront the existential threat of climate change.”",,"Arguing that crushing student loan debt is reducing rates of homeownership, discouraging people from starting businesses, and forcing students to drop out before graduating, Warren has declared that she would cancel up to $50,000 in student-loan debt for 42 million Americans, almost completely wiping out educational debt for three-quarters of the country’s borrowers.","In March, Warren released a plan to break up Facebook, Google, and Amazon, companies she argues have “too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy.”","Warren introduced the Universal Child Care and Early Learning Act in June. Among other provisions, it would ensure that no family pays more than seven percent of their income for child care, create a federally funded network of child care centers, and guarantee day care workers were paid on par with public school teachers.","Last fall, before officially declaring her candidacy, Warren outlined in broad strokes her vision for a progressive foreign policy in an op-ed in Foreign Affairs. Among other goals, Warren emphasized the importance of ensuring trade negotiations are “used to curtail the power of multinational monopolies and crack down on tax havens,” of making “honest assessments of the full costs and risks associated with going to war,” and of committing to “reprioritize diplomacy and reinvest in the State Department and the development agencies.”","After the August shootings that left 31 dead in El Paso and Dayton, however, Warren unveiled a wide-ranging plan aimed at reducing gun violence by 80 percent.","Warren has issued a Congressional call to action to protect reproductive rights. She proposes ending the Hyde Amendment and for federal laws that would enshrine the protections of Roe v. Wade no matter what state you live in. In the same proposal, she calls for repealing the Trump administration’s gag rule that bars certain physicians from discussing abortion with their patients, and for an increase in funding for Title X, the federal government’s family planning programs.",Warren announced early on in her campaign that she would not court or accept contributions from big-money donors — a decision that ultimately resulted in her finance director quitting the campaign.,"Warren released a plan to invest in rural America. The plan calls for increased government investment in rural communities, including creating a “public option for broadband”; strengthening health care and economic security; and breaking up the agribusiness corporations that have been crippling smaller farmers for years.","Warren’s housing plan is built around the American Housing and Economic Mobility Act, which she initially introduced to the Senate in 2018. The bill would set aside $500 billion over the next 10 years to “build, preserve, and rehab units that will be affordable to lower-income families.”","In June, Warren released a plan to fortify federal elections. The plan calls for modernizing election machines; blanket, federal standards including same-day registration, early voting, and vote-by-mail, rather than the current state-by-state regulations; measures to end gerrymandering; and making Election Day a national holiday.",Warren supports offering reparations to black Americans in recognition of the economic toll of slavery.
Marianne Williamson,"Williamson, a self-help guru and author of a dozen books, writes on her campaign website that she will “robustly support high-quality universal coverage for every American, including a medicare for all model.” The Williamson administration, would also provide citizens with “ongoing support from nutritionists, health coaches, therapists and mental health, exercise specialists, and other peripheral lifestyle treatment providers,” end subsidies for “unhealthy foods, like high-fructose corn syrup and hydrogenated fats,” and “develop ways to lower stress societally.”",Williamson wants to “focus on studying and promoting restorative justice programs and approaches for criminal justice reform throughout this country”; “create a trauma-informed environment inside the juvenile justice system”; and “support increasing the number of programs in prisons that provide life-skills for those who are incarcerated.”,,"Williamson says she would “provide a timely, ethical, transparent and straightforward path to citizenship for all law-abiding, productive immigrants living in the United States,” end family separation, and “increase border security intelligently through electronic surveillance and more patrol agents.”","Williamson declared on her website that “as President, I would argue, in no uncertain terms, that rapid, man-made climate change and global warming represents a clear and present danger to our people, to our democracy, and to the world at large.” To combat the climate crisis, Williamson has called for immediate re-entry into the Paris climate accord, and promised to “take unprecedented action between now and 2030 to actually bring the carbon we put in the atmosphere back into the earth where it came from — to reforest, transform our dirt back to soil on our farms, restore wetlands, peatlands, and increase phytoplankton and fisheries.” She supports the Green New Deal, but says it “doesn’t cover the whole range of measures we must undertake to reverse global warming.”",,Williamson supports free college.,,"Williamson has called for the establishment of a Department of Childhood and Youth. Williamson’s plan to care for children and families includes universal pre-K, maternal and paternal leave, mental health services for all children, mindfulness training in school, and more. During the first Democratic debates in June, she said that her number-one priority as president would be turning the United States into the best place in the world to raise children.","Williamson is calling for the creation of a “Department of Peace” to “coordinate not only the international peace-building agencies that already exist, but also the many domestic efforts — conflict resolution, restorative justice practices, police and social work programs, non-pharmaceutical mental health services, and other local peace-building efforts — in a way that increases their efficacy and begins to genuinely transform the experience of millions of our citizens.”","Williamson wants to institute universal background checks and mandatory waiting periods, eliminate the sale of assault rifles and semi-automatic weapons, ban bump stocks and high capacity magazines, see child safety locks on all guns and “strict control of gun use among children,” and expand red flag laws (also known as gun violence restraining orders), which temporarily remove firearms from the home of someone deemed to be a risk to themselves or others.","As president, she says, she would “vigorously resist any effort to restrict, limit, or diminish the reproductive rights and freedoms granted by Roe v. Wade.”","Williamson, who has pledged not to accept corporate PAC money or fossil fuel money, is calling for a constitutional amendment to establish public financing for federal campaigns.","Williamson has said she would repeal Trump’s 2017 tax cut for the wealthy and “put back in the middle class tax cuts.” She has also indicated an interest in eliminating the income cap on payroll taxes, eliminating the carried interest and ETF tax loopholes, and raising the estate tax.",,"Williamson wants to lower the voting age to 16 and pass a constitutional amendment to establish public financing of our federal campaigns. She also wants to end partisan gerrymandering, eliminate “unfounded” voting restrictions, and establish Election Day as a national holiday “(or Saturday).”","Reparations is one of the core issues of Williamson’s candidacy, on the order of $200 to $500 billion dollars. She proposes using the money, which would be disbursed over a period of 20 years, to fund educational and economic projects selected by “an esteemed council of African-American leaders.”"
Andrew Yang,"Yang has endorsed Medicare-for-All, focusing on the potential to control costs, expand coverage, and the benefits of ending job lock by Americans who stick with employers just to maintain their benefits.","Yang wants to remove the threat of jail time for users of opioids, as countries like Portugal have done. “We need to decriminalize the possession and use of small amounts of opioids,” his website reads. Yang also wants to be tough on Wall Street criminals and believes that “financial crimes should be treated the same way as any other crime,” and that “those perpetrating it should go to jail, and their punishment should reflect the amount of damage they’ve done to the economy and individuals they’ve defrauded.”","While Yang has a plethora of policy proposals — including everything from publicly funded journalists to a demand that the NCAA pay athletes — he prioritizes three: Universal Basic Income, Medicare for All, and what he calls Human-Centered Capitalism. The last calls for changing the way the U.S. gauges the success of the economy, and to move away from a simple focus on GDP to look at metrics such as “Median Income and Standard of Living, Health-adjusted Life Expectancy, Mental Health, Childhood Success Rates, Social and Economic Mobility, Absence of Substance Abuse.”",Yang wants to heighten border security and provide ways for undocumented immigrants to normalize their status. His website outlines a drive to create a “new tier of long-term permanent residency for anyone who has been here illegally for a substantial amount of time so that they can come out of the shadows and enter the formal economy and become full members of the community” with a chance to become a citizen after 18 years. He has said he will “deport any undocumented immigrant who doesn’t proactively enroll in the program.”,Yang wants to regulate and tax greenhouse gas emissions and improve efficiency standards. He sets himself apart from most progressives on climate policy with a focus on human engineering to cool the planet. He calls for investment in “large-scale geo-engineering measures like shoring up glaciers and reducing solar exposure to counteract the effects of climate change even as we reduce our emissions.”,,"Yang wants to make community colleges and vocational training accessible. He vows to “work to fund community colleges to a point where they can provide free (or drastically reduced) tuition to anyone from the community,” with an emphasis on technology training and partnerships with local employers.","Rather than the monopoly powers of Big Tech, Yang is focused on the threat of emerging artificial intelligence. Yang would create a Department of Technology, based in Silicon Valley, with a new Cabinet-level secretary tasked with identifying “emerging threats” and to work with industry to maximize the societal benefits of innovation.","Yang has promised to “fight for a paid family leave policy, requiring employers to offer at least 9 months of paid family leave, distributed between parents however they see fit; or 6 months of paid leave for a single parent.” The father of a child with autism, Yang also wants new federal programs “to identify and treat autistic children” as well as to “destigmatize” neurodiversity.","“My first principles concerning foreign policy are restraint and judgment — we should be very judicious about projecting force and have clear goals that we know we can accomplish,” Yang’s website reads. “If I send young men and women into harm’s way, they will know that vital national interests are at stake and there is a clear plan for them to achieve their goal in a reasonable time frame.”",Yang proposes a tiered licensing system for gun owners like those the DMV requires for auto drivers vs. truck drivers. He’d require background checks and gun locks for all levels. Anyone seeking a semi-automatic weapon or an assault rifle would have to complete more rigorous safety training and intrusive background checks.,"Yang calls for universal access to “safe and affordable abortion services” and wants state abortion laws put under the oversight of a board of doctors. Yang believes abortions can be made less necessary by guaranteeing access to contraception, and by providing universal basic income so prospective parents have more financial security.",,"Yang has called for taxing investment income — including capital gains and the “carried interest” received by hedge fund partners — like regular income. Yang has also called for a 0.1 percent tax on financial transactions to reduce speculation and help fund his Freedom Dividend, or universal basic income proposal. He wants to pay every American adult a basic income — branded a Freedom Dividend — of $1,000 a month. Yang is promoting universal basic income as a way to insulate America from the impending job loss and dislocation caused by automation and artificial intelligence.",,"Like many Democrats, Yang seeks automatic voter registration and the restoration of voting rights to those with past felony convictions (although not those convicted of murder), as well as a reduction in the number of offenses that trigger the loss of voting rights to begin with.","Yang has danced around reparations, voicing support for the goal of reducing wealth disparities experienced by black people, but highlighting other tools to address the problem, including government support to shore up the endowments of Historically Black Colleges and Universities as well as the poverty-alleviating benefits of his Freedom Dividend."
